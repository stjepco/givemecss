                <h1>The Tudor Heritage Black Bay One Reference 7923/001, A Unique Reference For Only Watch</h1>
                <p>We knew that Only Watch 2015 – hosted by Phillips with Bacs & Russo – would be good. I don't think any one of us expected this. For the first time in history, we will be seeing an officially unique product from the Rolex family. Yup, Tudor is participating in Only Watch, and today we have a glance at what we'll see. Boy does it look hot.</p>
                <p>The watch you see above is the incredibly rare Tudor Reference 7923, a watch we showed you when we went inside the Tudor Vault earlier this year. The watch is easiliy one of the most sought after and collectible vintage Tudors in the world, and it appears as if the folks at Tudor Geneva were paying attention. For Only Watch 2015, we will see a unique reference 7923/001 for sale that brings back all the attributes of the 1950s reference 7923.</p>
                <p>This means this unique Black Bay will feature a black bezel, a glossy black dial with gilt printing, gold baton hands, two lines of text including the depth rating – printed in red on this unique watch, and patinated luminous hour markers. You'll get the chamfered case and end-link-less bracelet that you may have seen in the 1950s, and a look that is absolutely killer. Unfortunately we won't see the new in-house Tudor MT5621 that we now find in the Pelagos and North Flag, but that's OK because the rest of this package is just awesome.</p>
